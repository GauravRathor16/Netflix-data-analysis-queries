# 🎬 Netflix Business Insights – 15 Real-World Problems & Solutions (SQL)

This project explores **15 real-world business problems faced by Netflix** and provides data-driven **SQL-based solutions** to each. The goal is to simulate how a data analyst would approach business challenges using structured queries and interpret results to drive strategic decisions.

## 📌 Objective

To demonstrate how SQL can be used to:
- Analyze subscription trends
- Identify popular content
- Evaluate user behavior
- Optimize marketing and recommendation strategies

## 📁 File Structure

- `NetFlix 15 Business Problems & Solutions.sql`  
   Contains SQL queries and subqueries addressing 15 analytical problems using Netflix-related data.

## 🧠 Key Business Problems Solved

1. Total revenue generated by Netflix in a given year
2. Monthly active user count
3. Top 10 most-watched shows/movies
4. Subscription churn analysis
5. Regional growth trends
6. Device/platform usage patterns
7. Genre popularity analysis
8. Peak streaming times
9. User retention by cohort
10. Effect of promotions/discounts
11. Gender-based viewing preferences
12. Average watch time per session
13. Completion rate of content
14. Recommendations performance
15. Seasonality in viewing behavior

*Each problem is framed and followed by the appropriate SQL solution.*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL syntax assumed)
- Relational databases (assumed schema with tables like  `users`, `content`, `watch_history`, etc.)

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Load the appropriate Netflix dataset into your SQL database (or simulate based on assumed schema).
2. Open the `.sql` file in your SQL IDE (like MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or DBeaver).
3. Execute queries problem by problem to see the insights.
4. Modify queries as needed based on your actual table names and schema.

## 📈 Use Cases

- Practicing SQL problem-solving
- Preparing for data analyst interviews
- Business analytics case studies
- Building data projects for portfolios
